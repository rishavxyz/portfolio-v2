Below is all what it takes to do it!

```ts
async function uploadOrUpdateFile({
  owner, repo, path, file, content, 
  sha = undefined, message = undefined
}: {
  owner: string; repo: string; path: string;
  file: string; content: string; sha?: string; message?: string;
}) {
  const response = await octokit.repos.createOrUpdateFileContents({
    owner, repo, path: [path, file].join("/"),
    message: message ?? `OctokitBot: ${sha ? 'Update' : 'Upload'} ${file}`,
    sha, content: Buffer.from(content).toString("base64")
  });
  
  return response;
}
```
