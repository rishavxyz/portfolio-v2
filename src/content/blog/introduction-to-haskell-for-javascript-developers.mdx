## Why Haskell?

### Functional Programming Buzz

Functional programming is gaining momentum, especially with libraries like ReactJS. By embracing functional concepts and immutable data structures, JavaScript developers can write cleaner, more readable code. Haskell takes functional programming to the next level, opening new doors for problem-solving and creativity.

### Immutable Everything

In Haskell, everything is immutable. A function cannot have side effects, meaning it always produces the same output for the same input. This predictability makes reasoning about your program easier. Imagine React components without unexpected side effects â€“ that's the power of purity!

## Let's jump into the world of Haskell.

Install `ghc` from your Linux distribution's package manager or from [haskell.org/ghc](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/). After installing `ghc`, open a terminal emulator and run the command `ghci`. This command comes from the `ghc` package.

## Declaring a variable

Variables can be global or function scoped and we declare them like this: `name = <initial_value>`.

```haskell
myNumber = 1
```

Don't put semi colons at the end. In Haskell, semi colons are not for ending a line. Haskell uses indentation instead.
Indentation must be at least one space or more.

> If the compiler throws error, indent more.

## Declare types

Haskell is a full statically typed language but you really don't need to declare types for simple expected variables or functions, they will auto generate at the compile time or runtime if using GHCI.

To declare a type for a variable, use the following syntax

```
name :: TYPE
```

The double colon `::` is the seperator, the left hand side is always the name and the right hand side is the type.

Haskell has several types, some most common types are, `Int, String, Char, Double, Bool`.

```haskell
myName :: String
myName = "Rishav"
```

From the type we can say that `myName` is a variable of String type.

For a function, the type declaration must have one or more argument type and a return type.

Let's say a function `isOdd` to check if a number is odd or not. Then the function's type be:

```
isOdd :: Int -> Bool
```

The `->` is seperates the arguments and the return type. As said you can have several arguments.

```
someArgs :: Int -> String -> Bool
```

Here the Int and the String are two seperate arguments, The last thing, the `Bool` is the return type.

## Writing first function

As said, a function consists of a name, one or more arguments and an expression.

```
-- Single argument
name arg = expression

-- Multiple arguments
name arg1 arg2 ... = expression
```

A real example of a function:

```haskell
isOdd :: Int -> Bool
isOdd num = odd num
```

We can see the type and say that the function `isOdd` takes only one argument of type integer and return a logical value.

Honestly you don't need to write types for simple functions, Haskell is smart enough to auto generate.

## Lists and Tuples

These are the most fundamentals of Haskell.

### Lists

In Haskell, lists are fundamental data structures. They can hold elements of the same type. Lists are basically **linked lists** under the hood. Here's how you define a list:

```haskell
myList :: [Int]
myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

You can also generate a list of numbers by defining a list `[]`, a start index e.g. `1`, followed by double period `..` and lastly an end value e.g. `5`.

```haskell
myList' = [Int]
myList' = [1..5]

-- myList' is will now be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Did you notice I just put a single quote at the end of the variable name?

Well in Haskell you are allowed to use a signle quote as a variable name too.


> What if I do `myList' = [1..]` ?

Well in that case you have just created an **infinite loop**. If you call `myList'` then it won't stop producing an integer until the process is terminated.

And if you're wondering, the list generation works for alphabets too!

```haskell
AtoZ = ['a'..'z']
-- AtoZ will be "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
```

Just make sure that the start and the end values are a `Char` type.
The generated output is a `String` which actually is a list of characters.

You can also add "steps" to generate a list. Steps are given before the `..` seperated by a comma.

```haskell
-- even numbers from 0 to 10
evenNumbers' = [0, 2 .. 10]

-- this will return [0,2,4,6,8,10]
```

#### Solving a basic coding problem

> Print all the odd numbers from 1 to an integer N

As from the problem statement, we can use the "steps" to generate the list of odds.

```haskell
myOdds :: Int -> [Int]
myOdds n = [1, 3 .. n]

-- myOdds 12 -> [1,3,5,7,9,11]
```

Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

> Get the maximum value from an array of integers

Haskell has built-in `maximum`, `minimum`, `compare`, `mod` etc function so you don't have to.

```haskell
getMax :: [Int] -> Int
getMax arr = maximum arr

-- The same can be written as this because of "currying"
getMax' :: [Int] -> Int
getMax' = maximum
```

For minimum just put `minimum` instead of maximum.

### Tuples

Tuples, on the other hand, can hold elements of different types in pair. For example:

```haskell
myTuple :: (Int, String)
myTuple = (42, "Answer")
```

Your can put 2 or more values too but generally we don't go beyond 2.

Tuples has their own function like `fst`, `snd` and as you can guess, `fst` will return the first element and `snd` will return the second.

```haskell
myName = ("Rishav", "Mandal")

getMyFirstName = fst myName
getMyLastName = snd myName
```

A more practical usage of tuples are storing data for something with it. Like this example:

```haskell
myName = "Rishav"
myName' = (length myName, myName) -- length function will reutrn the length of a string
-- myName -> (6, "Rishav")
```

## List Comprehension

List comprehensions are powerful tools in Haskell. They allow concise creation of lists based on existing ones. For example:

```haskell
addOne :: [Int]
addOne = [n+1 | n <- [1..10]]
```
The syntax is very easy to under stand, the above will be this:
> From a list of one to ten, we take each number and add one to it.

The cherry on top that we can also use predicates here.

> **Predicate:** is a function that determines whether something is true or not.

```haskell
addOne' :: [Int]
addOne' = [n+1 | n <- [1..10], n > 3]
```
Predicates are written on the right side seperated by a comma.

The above code can be said as:
> From a list of one to ten, we take each number such that the number is greater than three and add one to it.


## Higher order functions: Map and Filter

I will only disscuss about these two although Haskell has much more.

### Map

The `map` function applies a given function to each element of a list just similar to JavaScript's map. For example:

```haskell
doubleList :: [Int] -> [Int]
doubleList xs = map (* 2) xs
```

The abive code will multiply each element from the list by 2 and create a new list.

### Filter

The `filter` function selects elements from a list that satisfy a given condition. For instance:

```haskell
evenNumbers :: [Int] -> [Int]
evenNumbers xs = filter even xs
```

The above code will return a new list of even numbers.

**Remember,** both map and filter returns a new list and not in-place. 

### Lazy loading

Haskell is a lazy evaluated language, it uses [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying#:~:text=In%20mathematics%20and%20computer%20science,and%20produces%20objects%20in) technique in all the functions and converts one or more arguments into a sequence. So the above `evenNumbers` function can be written as below:

```haskell
evenNumbers = filter even
```

This is exact same as the above with the `xs` argument.

## Lambda Functions

In Haskell, functions are first-class citizens. You can pass them as arguments, return them from other functions, and assign them to variables. Lambda functions allow you to create anonymous functions on the fly:

```haskell
addOne :: Int -> Int
addOne = \x -> x + 1
```

## Function Composition

Haskell encourages function composition. You can combine functions to create new ones:

```haskell
squareAndDouble :: Int -> Int
squareAndDouble = (* 2) . (+ 2)
```

## The `$` Operator

The `$` operator is your friend. It helps avoid parentheses and clarifies function application:

```haskell
result = sum $ map (* 2) [1 .. 10]
```

Without the `$` we have to write the function as:

```haskell
result = sum (map (* 2) [1 .. 10])
```

## Type and Record

### Type

You can define custom data types using the `data` keyword. For example:

```haskell
data Person = Person
  { name :: String
  , age :: Int
  }
```

### Record

Records allow you to create structured data with named fields:

```haskell
alice :: Person
alice = Person {name = "Alice", age = 30}
```

## Some common coding problems are solved in Haskell

1. **Find the Last Element of a List**:
    ```haskell
    myLast :: [a] -> a
    myLast xs = last xs
    ```

2. **Find the Second-Last Element of a List**:
    ```haskell
    myButLast :: [a] -> a
    myButLast xs = xs !! (length xs - 2)
    ```

3. **Find the K'th Element of a List**:
    ```haskell
    elementAt :: [a] -> Int -> a
    elementAt xs n = xs !! (n - 1)
    ```

4. **Reverse a List**:
    ```haskell
    myReverse :: [a] -> [a]
    myReverse xs = reverse xs
    ```

5. **Check if a List is a Palindrome**:
    ```haskell
    isPalindrome :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool
    isPalindrome xs = xs == reverse xs
    ```
